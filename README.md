# Pizza-App-GUI
Pizza App (GUI view using Java Swing) is based on a real local pizza franchise Brickyard Hollow, located in Portland, ME

This project was adapted from its original command line view. 
The GUI here serves as the view in the MVC architecture.

Program enters prompting the user to input customer name and click a button to: 

1) Order from Menu 2) Build-Your-Own Pizza:

If 1) Order from Menu is selected, the user can select their desired pizza choice and select a size:

Following the decision, the final screen indicates the selections the user made:

If 2) Build-Your-Own Pizza is selected, the system opens a new panel where the user can select their desired BYO pizza attributes:

Though I did not implement this feature, I found the concept useful for developing a CheckBoxList component in swing:
